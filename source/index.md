I'm a **Software developer**, **Mathmatician**, and **Teacher**.  Currently
I work on high performance distributed systems at [Epoch Labs,
Inc.](http://www.epochlabs.com/), in beautiful Austin, Texas.  Previously
I was a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Oklahoma State
University.

Check out [my blog](/blog/) to see more of the stuff I think is cool; if you
like it, please [subscribe to get updates](/blog/feed.xml) (this is an Atom
feed).

You can see a brief account of my [experience](/experience/) if you'd like some
details, but one thing has remained the same throughout my entire career: I am
**technically minded, people focused, and driven by working on a team to solve
challenging problems**.
