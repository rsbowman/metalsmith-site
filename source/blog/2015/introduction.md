Hello!  I'm Sean Bowman, a former academic, sometime software developer, and
occasional teacher.  I received my Ph.D. in mathematics in 2012 from [John
Luecke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edwin_Luecke) at the University of
Texas, Austin, and from 2012--2015 I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at
Oklahoma State University.  In July 2015, I moved back to Austin to start a new
job as a software developer at Epoch Labs, Inc., a small company focusing on
high performance distributed database and messaging software.

Some things I'm interested in, or have been interested in in the past:

* my research as an academic mathematician focused on two main themes: first
  the relationship between bridge numbers of knots and other properties of the
  knots, especially special Dehn surgeries.
* Second, applications of 3--dimensional geometry and topology to problems in
  data analysis.  You can read more about both of these areas by looking at [my
  homepage](/).
* As a software developer, I have lots of interests.  One big one is
  programming languages.  I've had a thing for them since high school, and they
  continue to fascinate me.
* I'm interested in concurrent programming and systems programming in general.
* As I mentioned before, I've done some work in machine learning.
* I love things at the intersection of computer science and math, like category
  theory.
* I dig software engineering per se, its practices, and tools of the trade.

I will probably get around to writing about all of these things at some point;
I hope you enjoy and maybe even learn something!  I'd love to hear from you if
you have constructive comments about what I've written.

Thanks for reading, best regards to everyone!
